# MyToken
This Solidity program is a simple token contract that demonstrates the basic functionality of creating, minting, and burning tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this program is to serve as a starting point for those who are new to Solidity and want to understand how token contracts work.

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes the following functionalities:
- Storing the token name, abbreviation, and total supply.
- Mapping addresses to their respective token balances.
- Functions to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.

This program serves as an introduction to Solidity programming and token contract development. It can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `MyToken.sol`). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

```solidity

/*
       REQUIREMENTS
    1. Your contract will have public variables that store the details about your coin (Token Name, Token Abbrv., Total Supply)
    2. Your contract will have a mapping of addresses to balances (address => uint)
    3. You will have a mint function that takes two parameters: an address and a value. 
       The function then increases the total supply by that number and increases the balance 
       of the “sender” address by that amount
    4. Your contract will have a burn function, which works the opposite of the mint function, as it will destroy tokens. 
       It will take an address and value just like the mint functions. It will then deduct the value from the total supply 
       and from the balance of the “sender”.
    5. Lastly, your burn function should have conditionals to make sure the balance of "sender" is greater than or equal 
       to the amount that is supposed to be burned.

contract MyToken {

    // public variables here
    string public tokenName = "XERON";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "XRN";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;

    // mapping variable here
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    // mint function
    function mint (address _address, uint _value) public {
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    // burn function
    function burn (address _address, uint _value) public {
        if(balances[_address] >= _value) {
            totalSupply -= _value;
            balances[_address] -= _value;
        }
    }
